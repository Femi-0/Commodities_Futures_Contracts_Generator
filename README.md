## Background
In this project, we build a tool that analyzes historical data and predicts prices to help commodities traders and investors make informed decisions. This project samples data of the top 4 metals, Gold, Silver, Platinum, and Palladium, for ten years obtained from Yahoo Finance and Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). This tool adapts extensively trained algorithm trading models, machine learning, and natural language processing techniques to forecast momentum and prices.

### Data Source
We download data as CSV files from Yahoo Finance and Federal Reserve Economic Data. These websites provide sufficient information on the four metals selected for this project.
